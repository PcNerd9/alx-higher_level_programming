# Learning Python Data Structures

This repository is dedicated to my journey of understanding data structures in Python, particularly tuples and lists.

## My Goals

- [ ] Learn the basics of tuples and lists.
- [ ] Understand the differences between tuples and lists.
- [ ] Explore various data structures in Python, including dictionaries and sets.
- [ ] Practice creating, manipulating, and iterating over tuples and lists.

## Tasks

- [ ] Task 1: write a function that prints all integers of a list.
- [ ] Task 2: write a function that retrieves an element from a list like in C.
- [ ] Task 3: write a function that replaces an element of a list at a specific position (like in C).
- [ ] Task 4: write a function that prints all integers of a list, in reverse order.
- [ ] Task 5: Write a function that replaces an element in  a list at a specific position without modifying the original list(like in C).
- [ ] Task 6: Write a function that removes all characters c and C from a string.
- [ ] Task 7: Write a function that prints a matrix of integers
- [ ] Task 8: Write a function that adds 2 tuples.
- [ ] Task 9: Write a function that returns a tuple with the lenght of a string and its first character.
- [ ] Task 10: Write a function that finds the biggest integer of a list.
- [ ] Task 11: Write a function that finds all multiples of 2 in a list.
- [ ] Task 12: Write a function that deletes the item at a specific position in a list.
- [ ] Task 13: Complete source code challenge
- [ ] Task 14: Write a function in C that checks if a singly linked list is a palindrome.
