# 0x0A. Python - Inheritance

## Description
This directory covers the principles of inheritance in Python. The projects illustrate how to create subclasses, use super(), and manage multiple inheritance. Understanding inheritance is crucial for implementing polymorphism and code reusability.

## Project Structure

- **0-lookup.py**: A function that returns the list of available attributes and methods of an object.
- **1-my_list.py**: A class that inherits from list and includes a method to print sorted list.
- **2-is_same_class.py**: A function that checks if an object is an instance of a specified class.
- **3-is_subclass.py**: A function that checks if a class is a subclass of another.
- **4-inherits_from.py**: A function that checks if an object is an instance of a class that inherited from a specified class.
- **5-base_geometry.py**: A base class for geometry shapes with a method to area calculation.
- **6-rectangle.py**: A class that inherits from BaseGeometry and defines a rectangle.
- **7-square.py**: A class that inherits from Rectangle to define a square.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- Ubuntu 20.04 (or other Unix-based systems)
