# 0x0C. Python - Classes

## Description
This directory contains projects that further explore classes in Python, focusing on attributes, methods, and class hierarchy. Understanding class mechanisms is fundamental for building efficient and maintainable code.

## Project Structure

- **0-square.py**: Defines a basic square class.
- **1-square.py**: Implements the initialization of a square with size attributes.
- **2-square.py**: Adds a method to calculate the area of the square.
- **3-square.py**: Implements a method to print the square.
- **4-square.py**: Introduces validation for size attributes.
- **5-square.py**: Demonstrates the concept of class methods and static methods.

## Technologies Used
