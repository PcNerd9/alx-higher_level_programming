# 0x07. Python - Test-Driven Development

## Description
This directory focuses on test-driven development (TDD) in Python. The projects demonstrate how to write tests for functions and classes, ensuring code correctness and reliability through the use of unit tests and integration tests.

## Project Structure

- **0-add_integer.py**: A function that adds two integers with a corresponding test.
- **2-matrix_divided.py**: A function that divides all elements of a matrix by a given divisor with tests.
- **3-say_my_name.py**: A function that prints a name with proper tests.
- **4-print_square.py**: A function that prints a square of a specified size with tests.
- **5-text_indentation.py**: A function that adds indentation to a text with tests.
- **tests/**: A directory containing test files for the respective modules.

## Technologies Used
