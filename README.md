Covers file input and output:
- Reading and writing JSON data
- Serializing and deserializing objects

### 0x0C-python-almost_a_circle
A mini-project to consolidate OOP concepts:
- Building classes for geometric shapes (Base, Rectangle, Square)
- Emphasis on inheritance, serialization, and unit testing

### 0x0D-SQL_introduction
Covers introductory SQL commands:
- Creating, selecting, and modifying databases and tables
- Querying data

### 0x0E-SQL_more_queries
More advanced SQL:
- User management, subqueries, and joining tables
- Working with real-world data scenarios

### 0x0F-python-object_relational_mapping

- Variables, loops, and functions
- Command-line interaction using Node.js

### 0x13-javascript_objects_scopes_closures
Covers advanced JavaScript concepts:
- Object-oriented programming in JavaScript
- Closures and scope management

### 0x15-javascript-web_jquery
Introduces JavaScript for web development:
- Manipulating the DOM with jQuery
- Creating interactive web pages

## Learning Outcomes

This repository demonstrates my progression as a developer, particularly focusing on:
- Gaining proficiency in Python and JavaScript
- Applying concepts of data structures, algorithms, and object-oriented programming
- Learning modern software development practices, such as test-driven development (TDD), object-relational mapping (ORM), and web development techniques

## How to Use

Each folder contains individual project directories, which in turn include Python and JavaScript scripts, supporting files, and test cases. You can run the Python scripts by navigating to their respective directories and executing them, or running the JavaScript files using Node.js where appropriate.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Node.js (for JavaScript files)
- Basic understanding of Python and JavaScript
- Database (for SQL-related tasks)

## Conclusion

This repository is a work in progress as I continue to enhance my skills in both Python and JavaScript. Feel free to explore the code, raise issues, and suggest improvements.
